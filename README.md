# Silent Dropping of Columns in R Data Frame Subsetting

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors. When you attempt to select columns that do not exist in the data frame, R silently drops those columns instead of throwing an error. This can lead to unexpected results and make debugging more challenging.

## Bug Description
The bug arises when using character vectors to select columns in a data frame.  If the character vector contains column names that are not present in the data frame, R will omit them without any warning or error. This behavior can be problematic because it might not be immediately apparent that data is missing.

## Bug Reproduction
The `bug.R` file contains code that reproduces this issue. The code attempts to select columns `A`, `C`, and `D` from a data frame that only has columns `A` and `B`. The result is a data frame with only column `A`, while columns `C` and `D` are silently dropped.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.R` file provides a solution to handle this situation more robustly. It uses the `intersect()` function to find the common columns between the data frame and the vector of column names, thus preventing unintended column omission and providing more explicit error handling.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.R` to see the buggy code and its output.
3. Open `bugSolution.R` to see the improved, more robust code.
